# 🎨 Deploy Background Sync Service to Render

## What This Solves

Your tank monitoring app currently takes 30+ seconds to load because it calculates everything in real-time. This background service will:

✅ **Continuously sync** real data from Central Tank Server to Supabase cache  
✅ **Pre-calculate** all run rates, predictions, and status  
✅ **Reduce load time** from 30+ seconds to 2-3 seconds  
✅ **Run 24/7** so your cache is always fresh  

## Step 1: Run the Migration First

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xxcpqjtnsjoxmlqokuj
2. **Go to SQL Editor** → **New Query**
3. **Copy and paste** the migration from `supabase/migrations/20250628122537_purple_oasis.sql`
4. **Click Run** - this creates empty tables ready for real data

## Step 2: Deploy to Render

### Option A: GitHub Repository (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
3. **Click "New +"** → **"Background Worker"**
4. **Connect your GitHub repository**
5. **Configure the service**:

**Service Settings:**
- **Name**: `tank-sync-service`
- **Environment**: `Node`
- **Build Command**: `npm ci`
- **Start Command**: `node services/production-sync-service.js`

**Environment Variables:**
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY_HERE

CENTRAL_TANK_SERVER=https://central-tank-server.onrender.com

SUPABASE_URL=https://xxcpqjtnsjoxmlqokuj.supabase.co

NODE_ENV=production

SYNC_INTERVAL=30000

CLEANUP_INTERVAL=3600000
```

6. **Click "Create Background Worker"**

### Option B: Manual Deployment

If you prefer not to use GitHub:

1. **Create a new Background Worker** in Render
2. **Upload your project files** (focus on `services/` folder and `package.json`)
3. **Use the same settings** as Option A above

## Step 3: Monitor Deployment

### Check Deployment Logs

In your Render dashboard, go to your service and check the **Logs** tab. You should see:

```
🚀 Starting Production Background Sync Service...
📊 Central Tank Server: https://central-tank-server.onrender.com
💾 Supabase URL: https://xxcpqjtnsjoxmlqokuj.supabase.co
⏱️ Sync Interval: 30 seconds
🔍 Testing connections...
✅ Central Tank Server connection successful
✅ Supabase connection successful
✅ Production Sync Service started successfully
🔄 Continuous sync active - your app will have sub-3 second load times!
✅ Sync #1 completed in 1250ms - 2 stores, 8 tanks
```

### Verify It's Working

1. **Check Supabase Tables**:
   - Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
   - Check `tank_logs` table - should have real data
   - Check `processed_tank_data` table - should have calculated metrics

2. **Test Your App**:
   - Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Should load in 2-3 seconds with your real store data
   - Click "Database Status" to verify Supabase connection

## Step 4: Expected Results

### Performance Improvement
- **Load Time**: 30+ seconds → 2-3 seconds
- **Data Source**: Real data from your Central Tank Server
- **Updates**: Fresh data every 30 seconds
- **Reliability**: 24/7 background service

### Console Messages in Your App
```
✅ Using Supabase as primary data source
📊 Loaded 2 stores with 8 tanks
💾 Data source: Supabase
```

### Service Logs (Every 30 seconds)
```
✅ Sync #2 completed in 980ms - 2 stores, 8 tanks
✅ Sync #3 completed in 1100ms - 2 stores, 8 tanks
💚 Health Check - Uptime: 5m, Syncs: 10, Last: 15s ago, Errors: 0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify the service key has proper permissions
- Check build logs for dependency issues

### No Data in App
- Verify migration ran successfully in Supabase
- Check service logs for sync errors
- Ensure Central Tank Server is accessible

### Slow Performance
- Check if service is running and syncing
- Verify Supabase tables have recent data
- Monitor sync frequency in service logs
